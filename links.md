## How do I insert links?

Very easy in MarkDown: just type `[link itself](URL of the link)`.  
For example, `[Google](www.google.com)` will create a link to *Google.com*.  
Try it: [Google](www.google.com)  

## How to link existing document in this repository?

Also very easy, try this: `[Link to picture document](pic.md)`.  
[Link to picture document](pic.md)  
Note here, that I can link to any *MarkDown file* in this repository.
